Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.  TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {UpgradeableProxy-constructor}.  CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\",\"methods\":{},\"stateVariables\":{\"_initialized\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\"},\"_initializing\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\"}}},\"userdoc\":{\"methods\":{}}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/proxy/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":999999},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"contracts/proxy/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8eee8bd8c216a3e437bf7a4c9844348f47a2d990e5b06cd96d250e33ab04c25a\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c6bb2af880b12be26b148ee99ac3a984168e7fc74721bab9cd44598a0669b038\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPfFDaXZbThJgaVim7nvxrw1RuD2xKWCG89K6pznmC8pJ\"]}},\"version\":1}",
